TweetStats
==========

An application to get common statistics (recent tweets, common friends) given the twitter handle.  Developed to get familiar with Twitter REST APIs, Perl Dancer and Web-Application development in general. 

Used Perl Dancer (http://perldancer.org/, https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer), to write a web app with these features:

* Given a twitter username, display their most recent tweets
* Hit the twitter API on the backend/perl-side
* Given two twitter usernames, display the intersection of the people that they follow

Deployed the app on heroku and it can be accessed here:
